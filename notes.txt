JS types are: 
  1. Dynamic (Types are decided as code is running) 
  2. Weak (Types are often coerced so JS can work with it)

Examples:
let elevenString = '1' + 1; // '11'
let zero = '1' - 1; // 0
let emptyString = [] + []; // ''
let objectObject = [] + {}; // '[object Object]'

Typescript is a superset of JS. It has more features.
This means that all JS code can be converted to TS, but TS code cannot be converted to JS.

Types is TS are static and strong.

Typescript code compiles to JS. JS code is interpreted. So both interpreted and compiled is happening.

TS can be useful as a Dev tool, by providing autocompletion, hints etc.
TS can also generate JS code for various targets/platforms.
