They give us the ability to describe object types.

Let's try to create a type called User, which:
  1. If it is a human user, will have a full name property.
  2. If it is a AI agent, will have a model name property.

If we describe them using regular object types:

type User = {
  name: string,
  id: string | number,
  fullName?: string,
  modelName?: string
};

let humanUser: User = {name: "Nik", id: "123", fullName: "Nik Nik Nik"};
let AiAgent: User = {name: "NikModel", id: "123", modelName: "Nik.1.2.3"};

The use of optional properties everywhere is not the best coding practice, so we use interfaces.

interface User = {
  name: string; // semi-colon instead of commas
  id: string | number;
}

interface Human extends User {
  fullName: string;
}

interface Agent extends User {
  modelName: string;
}

It is generally recommended to use an interface for objects, as they are faster and more flexible.
